Measured 'brightness temperature' versus elevation angle is converted to air temperature versus altitude using a modified statistical retrieval procedure with a Bayesian component. An altitude temperature profile (ATP) is produced in this manner every 13 seconds or approximately 3 km along the flight path. The ATP can be used to produce a color-coded temperature curtain (CTC) of the temperature field which the ER2 has flown through, and to identify the tropopause location.

The S-band operated in two modes: precipitation mode and attenuated mode.  The precipitation mode was the normal or full-power mode, and the attenuated mode was the low-power mode.  The profiler alternated between modes collecting either 7 or 9 consecutive precipitation mode profiles separated by 1 attenuated mode profile.  Both modes processed radar pulses collected during a 7-second dwell before calculating the Doppler velocity spectra at each radar range gate that were separated by 60-meters in the vertical.  The attenuated and precipitation mode data are available in moment, pop spectra (uncalibrated raw spectra) and calibrated spectra hourly files.  The S-band spectra were calibrated against the surface disdrometer to determine a radar calibration constant.

The instrument has two fixed antennas, one pointing at nadir and the second pointing approximately 33 degree ahead of nadir. The beam width of the antenna is 3 degree in the vertical and horizontal directions which, for a 20 km altitude, yields a nadir footprint at the surface of 1 km. Each Antenna measures the doppler velocity, doppler spectral width, and reflectivity factor. Doppler velocities provide a measure of the pulse volume-weighted hydrometer motion (hydrometer fallspeed + air motion.) Vertical air motion can be calculated from the nadir beam by removing the fallspeed contribution with an approximation.  Along-track horizontal air motion can be calculated by combining doppler wind speeds from forward and nadir beams. The linear depolarization ratio (the ratio of the cross-polar to the co-polar reflectivites) can be measured along forward beam. EDOP is a coherent Doppler radar system at 9.6 GHz.

It is functionally similar to AMSU-A/B, but with additional channels. There are three bands: an 8-channel band near 50-GHz, used for primary temperature sounding; a 10-channel band near 118 GHz, used for secondary temperature sounding and assessment of scattering; a 7-channel band near 183 GHz, used for water vapor sounding. The instrument is continuously self-calibrating using internal calibration targets. Radiometric sensitivity at the composite sampling cells provided in the archive is typically 0.1 and ranges up to 0.25 K for the stratospheric channels. Calibration accuracy is estimated at better than 1 K for temperature sounding and better than 2 K for water vapor sounding. Temperature weighting function peaks are distributed between the surface and the flight altitude.
